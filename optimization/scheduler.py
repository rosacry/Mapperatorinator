    Create a schedule with a constant learning rate preceded by a warmup period during which the learning rate
    increases linearly between 0 and the initial lr set in the optimizer.

    Source: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/optimization.py#L50

    Args:
        optimizer ([`~torch.optim.Optimizer`]):
            The optimizer for which to schedule the learning rate.
        num_warmup_steps (`int`):
            The number of steps for the warmup phase.
        last_epoch (`int`, *optional*, defaults to -1):
            The index of the last epoch when resuming training.

    Returns:
        `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR` with the appropriate schedule.
